Chapter 2:  Requirement Gathering and Persona Creation



Story
John has been fond of travelling since childhood. Advancing in years, he has started enjoying solo trips more and more. Even though, while travelling alone too, he loves socializing with the people at his destinations. John makes sure he utilizes every extended weekend and every short vacation properly. He has travelled to more than 15 countries in the last 7 to 8 years of his life. With each new adventure, John believes, he understands himself better. 
Last year, John was on his tour to the famous places in India, and he visited Qutub Minar. Since history and social sciences are some of the favourite subjects John, undertook an exhaustive study of the Minar, and collected every possible detail he could collect. He was simply amazed by knowing this information. But he thinks he spent a lot of time understanding just one monument. Since he has committed to most of the beautiful ancient monuments of India in the coming years, he would like to have something to accompany him on his search and fulfil his curiosity to know about these monuments easily.

Chapter 5:   UI Evaluation




Chapter 6:   Conclusion and Future Enhancements 

We have successfully created a Virtual Tourist Guide website. Users can search for cities as input and get an overview about all the prominent monuments of the city. An image based search of the monuments can show the users all the information. This type of search is vital as when the tourists don’t know the name of the place they are visiting. 

Future Enhancements
Chatbot to answer user queries in real time
Multilingual support to cater to non-English speaking user base
Incorporate rating with recommendations- Recommend only the top rated monuments on Google Maps by adding a filter
Include voice search to enable people to search the monuments/cities by voice.
Expand monument directory
